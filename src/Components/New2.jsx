                        Matcha tea has gained immense popularity in World
                        recently. The name "抹茶" (mattya or matcha) translates
                        from Japanese as "ground tea." Contrary to common myth,
                        this tea was invented in China, not in Japan as commonly
                        believed. During the Tang Dynasty in China (618-907 AD),
                        tea leaves were roasted and ground into a powder, which
                        was then brewed with salt and mint. During the Song
                        Dynasty (960-1279 AD), powdered tea became more popular:
                        it was brewed by pouring hot water over the tea powder
                        in a cup and whisking it with a bamboo whisk until a
                        frothy layer formed. The preparation of powdered tea
                        became a ritual among the Chan Buddhists. They brought
                        tea to Japan along with Buddhism. This led to the
                        formation of the Zen school and the transformation of
                        the tea-drinking process into a complex ceremony with
                        many rules and conventions.

                        "A person who has not drunk tea is out of harmony with
                        the universe." Japanese proverb

                        In the modern world, powdered tea has gained popularity
                        due to its invigorating properties and high vitamin
                        content. Nowadays, you can buy this tea in many
                        specialized stores and even in the mass market, as the
                        simpler grade of powder is used in tea cocktails and
                        culinary applications.

                        To make powdered tea, young leaves of the early
                        vegetative stage are used, and minimal processing is
                        involved. As a result, we obtain a highly concentrated
                        powder rich in beneficial elements that are easily
                        absorbed by the body. With just one bowl of matcha, you

                        Research has shown that matcha antioxidant levels are
                        nearly 140 times higher than regular green tea
                        varieties. Additionally, this beverage contains the
                        amino acid L-theanine, which uplifts and stabilizes mood
                        without caffeine side effects. Matcha is also abundant
                        in calcium, potassium, and vitamins A, B, C, E, and K.
                        Moreover, the powdered form is easily and rapidly

                        Place a glass or clay teapot on a glass-ceramic stovetop

                        There are no strict rules here, but using a glass teapot
                        adds visual pleasure to the magical transformation of
                        simple water and tea leaves into an extraordinary
                        beverage!

                        prescribed by the Tea Canon. But a funnel is needed to
                        immerse all the tea leaves into the boiling water at
                        once, distribute them there, and start brewing. Wooden

                        Important questions: how much tea should you use in
                        weight or volume? How do you calculate the amount of
                        water for the right ratio of ingredients? The
                        calculation is that for 100 ml of water, you need 1 gram
                        of tea. But these are approximate guidelines, and each
                        type of tea requires its own approach. Red and green
                        shen teas require slightly less tea. More mellow aged
                        tea, tea buds, or Hei Cha require a little more. Shu
                        Pu-erh tea is taken at a ratio of about 9 grams per 0.6
                        liters, and tea buds - 15 grams per 1 liter. The taste
                        should be dense and mild, but it all depends on personal
                        preference. There are no universal recipes here.

                        What kind of tea is suitable for brewing? You can brew
                        any tea, it's all about being rational. Not all teas are
                        good for brewing, just as not all are suitable for
                        steeping. Based on observations, there are teas that
                        seem to be specially created for brewing and behave
                        perfectly during this thermal processing:

                        will give an interesting result. Light oolongs, such as
                        Tie Guan Yin and Taiwanese teas, give an uninteresting
                        and average brew during brewing, and some of the
                        delicate aromas are lost. Such teas become faceless,
                        characterless. They are good for steeping, where there
                        is no active heating and rapid evaporation.

                        First, put the tea in a gaiwan and pour cold water over
                        it. Then put the kettle on the fire. The water begins to

                    <p>
                        Pour out the water for soaking the tea from the gaiwan.
                        All unnecessary debris settles on the bottom, and the
                        tea is rinsed and swollen.

                        wet and hold their shape on their own. This advice is
                        relevant for loose tea, which is difficult to transfer
                        to boiling water until you give the mass a round

                        it's time to toss in the tea. This is an informative way

                        dance of two elements. The heating does not stop during
                        this time. Now you need to watch the process of
                        re-boiling the water. When you notice the beginning of
                        boiling, stop heating, and turn off the stove or burner.
                        Dense teas in tea heads can be boiled a little to fully
                        reveal the aroma. It is permissible to turn off such tea
                        varieties as green or young sheng a little earlier than
                        the start of boiling.

                        The first bubbles that separate from the walls are not
                        oxygen but nitrogen, which is contained in the water and
                        a precursor to boiling. The next stage is "crab eyes,"
                        followed by "fish eyes" with larger bubbles, "pearl
                        threads," and "the sound of wind in the pines." The
                        romantic names accurately reflect the metamorphosis of
                        boiling water.

                        The boiling process is complete, but not quite. You need

                        The tea will gradually start to unfold and, at some

                        Another important detail that conservative tea lovers

                        You can mix Shu Pu-erh and red tea in a ratio of 3:1. A
                        part of red tea will add a note of fire, a peculiar

                        proportion of 3:1, you can achieve an intriguing effect
                        on the finished product. The resulting drink will have a
                        different taste. The feeling after drinking the tea is
                        dense, even, monolithic, and there is a sense of
                        composure.

                        Advantages of brewing tea

                    <p>
                        Brewing tea is always convenient and quick. You can take
                        a portable stove, gas, and water with you on any outdoor
                        trip. It makes for a pleasant tea-time atmosphere by a
                        river or in the forest. A good cup of tea is an
                        excellent addition to the natural scenery, adding a
                        touch of warmth, coziness, and home. It harmoniously
                        fits into the situation, allowing you to immerse
                        yourself in your senses, meditate, and admire the
                        surrounding environment.

                    <p>
                        It is worth noting that this brewing method can help to
                        reveal the taste of teas that were exclusively used in
                        tea bags. Traditional Shu Pu-erh tea becomes a light
                        drink, but when brewed, it opens up, becoming
                        voluminous, oily, velvety, and wonderfully drinkable.
                        Conversely, the tea that you enjoy in a tea bag may not
                        reveal its full charm when brewed. However, it is still
                        worth trying and conducting experiments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, let's return to the brewing method from the tea
                        classic of Lu Yu and delve into the philosophical
                        teachings. It states:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Tea, by its nature, is modest, and it should not be
                        brewed in large quantities. If tea is brewed in large
                        quantities, its taste becomes weak and bland. Sometimes,
                        after filling a cup and drinking half of it, one feels
                        the poor taste. What can be said about a large quantity?
                        The tea color is pale yellow, and its aroma is stunning.
                        If the taste of the drink is sweet, then it is Jia. If
                        it is not sweet, but bitter - it is Chuan. If it is
                        bitter when swallowed, but sweet in the throat, then it
                        is true tea."

                        The word "chaban (Tea Tray)" is usually used to describe
                        a tray or a table on which all the necessary utensils
                        and tea tools are located. Chaban greatly simplifies tea
                        drinking. You can pour water on it thanks to a pallet or
                        a special tube for draining water. So spilled liquid
                        will not interfere with tea drinking.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tea lovers have long been accustomed to this item of tea
                        utensils, although in fact 3 different items are often
                        hidden under the "chaban (Tea Tray)".
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most convenient option is a tea tray with a tray
                        Chapan (kit.茶盘, pinyin chápán). During the first
                        brewing or after warming the dishes, the water simply
                        flows down the chapan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Why with a "p"? Because the chaban (kit. 茶板, pinyin
                        chábǎn) is more correct to call it a plank without a
                        pallet/drain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A practical version of the chaban (Tea Tray) may look
                        like this. Thanks to the slots, the board will retain a
                        small amount of moisture and will not allow it to spread
                        on the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another stylish option is Hucheng (壶承 húchéng). A
                        hollow stand with a small hole, usually small in size,
                        is suitable for an office or a small tea table. The most
                        common variants are made of ceramic or pressed stone.

                        For simplicity, we (and many other tea enthusiasts)

                        Chabans (Tea trays) are usually made of bamboo, wood, or

                        The most common variants are made of bamboo. This
                        material has quite a lot of advantages:

                        Easy to care for: after a tea party, it is enough to
                        pour water out of the tray, wash off the tea stains and
                        wipe dry;

                        The main disadvantage of bamboo is that it is almost
                        always made from prefabricated materials. Therefore,
                        with frequent use, the glue can leak, especially if the
                        pallet also consists of bamboo. When buying bamboo
                        Chabans (Tea Trays), be sure to check the evenness of
                        the joints and the quality of the assembly.

                        Wooden Chaban (Tea Tray) is slightly heavier than bamboo
                        ones, but still quite light.

                        Yes, such Chabans (Tea Trays) are significantly more
                        expensive than bamboo ones, but they are much stronger
                        and more durable. Care is similar: after tea, pour water
                        out of the tray, wash off the tea stains, and wipe dry.
                        Chabans (Tea Trays) should drain well and completely,
                        along with the quality of the connections.

                        are suitable for a small table;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a wide range of prices, you can find an option for
                        any budget.

                    <p>
                        It is imperative to remember that such Chabans (Tea
                        Trays) are very fragile and easily split off. They are
                        more suitable for home tea parties.

                    <p>
                        There are also combined options, for example, bamboo top
                        + ceramic pallet.

                            Chaban (Tea tray) with a ceramic pallet and a bamboo

                        The most reliable option is stone. It is stylish,
                        reliable, and durable. Such a Chaban (Tea tray) will not
                        crack and will not chip. A Chaban (Tea tray) can be used
                        for decades, but its disadvantages include rarity,
                        weight, and price. If the stone Chaban (Tea tray) has
                        wooden / metal inserts, make sure they dry after tea.
                        Use soda if you can't wipe off the tea stain with a wet
                        cloth. Besides effectively removing the stain, it leaves
                        no foreign odor on the Chaban (tea tray).

                    <p>
                        We will also mention models made entirely of metal or
                        with a metal pallet. Yes, they are simple, inexpensive,
                        and reliable, but they have one significant
                        disadvantage: noise. Remember the sound of rain drumming
                        on the metallic tint of the window? If such a roar can
                        confuse you, then give up your metal Chaban (Tea tray).

                        Water from the Chaban (Tea Tray) can be drained in two
                        ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first way is to drain it on a pallet. To do this,
                        the upper surface of the board is equipped with holes or
                        a grid through which water easily enters the pallet.
                        Sometimes it is a pull-out, most often a plastic pallet.
                        In some Chabans (Tea Trays), the base itself serves as a
                        pallet. The first option is easier to care for, since
                        the base made of wood/bamboo may crack if used
                        incorrectly.

                        This board is quite autonomous and does not require
                        additional devices.

                        The tray is durable and airtight. You do not need to
                        worry about draining water during tea drinking.

                        If you have chosen a large tank for draining or brought
                        it outside, then you will not need to worry about
                        whether the water tank has filled up.

                        There will not be water in the Chaban (Tea Tray) itself
                        for a long time, so it will last longer.

                    <p>
                        The tea pipe may become clogged with tea leaves, and
                        then the water will not leave.

                    <p>
                        Typical gurgling sounds may be produced during draining.

                    <p>
                        It is necessary to check whether the tube has jumped out
                        of the tank.

                    <p>
                        There are also options with pallets, into which, if

                        If you want to brew pu-erh in the office, we recommend
                        using a teapot. This item is also known as a button
                        teapot or a gongfu glass teapot. Kung Fu (kit. 功夫)
                        translates as the highest skill and indicates the
                        reputation of this type of teapot as an object for
                        brewing. It combines a teapot (a flask with a button), a
                        sieve, and a jug for filling (a flask is inserted
                        there). Three in one! Brew tea by spilling or infusing —
                        this is a universal tool and an affordable solution to
                        the task of brewing tea in the office.

                    <p>
                        In most models of these types, the spout bends slightly
                        at the end. Thanks to this bend, not a single extra drop
                        falls from the nose of the kettle. You can safely use
                        the teapot in the workplace, without fear of soiling or
                        dripping the table. Cool!

                        Our recommendation would be to use the straight method.
                        So you will get three, five, or more flavors from one
                        brew. Use boiling water.

                    <p>
                        Take 8 grams of tea if you like a balanced strength.
                        Time of the first welding: 10 seconds. Further straits:
                        6+ seconds. Do you like strong shu pu-erh? Increase the
                        brewing time to 15-20 seconds, and use 10-15 grams
                        instead of 8.
                    </p>

                        A 15-second technical welding is required before brewing
                        tightly pressed pu-erh. This will allow you to saturate
                        the sheet with water and soften a broken piece of
                        pancake or brick. After the technical spill, the tea
                        will be brewed stronger.

                    <p>
                        Gaiwan (more often porcelain or glass) is a special cup
                        with a lid for brewing tea. The walls of the gaiwan do
                        not absorb the aroma or taste of tea (unlike a clay
                        teapot). With a gaiwan, it is easy to control the drain
                        speed. This is critical because controlled draining plus
                        ease of use allows you to cope with even the most
                        "capricious" tea. When you brew tea in a gaiwan, the
                        reverse side of the lid collects a bright and clean
                        aroma. Pay attention to him. Gaiwan is suitable for
                        those who want to control the brewing process and
                        appreciate the aroma more than the taste.
                    </p>

                        If you use a gaiwan, it is better to brew tea in spills.
                        Spillage brewing is when you make fast (up to 1 second)
                        brews. Each individual brew is called a spill, because
                        the water does not linger in the dishes, but "spills"
                        through them into a bowl, turning into tea. The first
                        spill is soft and delicate. The second one is visible
                        and bright. There is a mature taste peak in the third
                        spill. The fourth is the beginning of a gradual fading.
                        Together, all brewing is called the "melody of taste".
                        Each tea has its own melody.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take 5 grams of tea per 100 ml of water. Use boiling
                        water. Warm up the gaiwan. Do not let the gaiwan cool
                        down and immediately put tea in it. When the tea is in a
                        heated bowl, wait 10 + seconds for the tea to soak up
                        the heat. Getting shu pu-erh to the first spill will
                        make the tea tastier.

                    <p>
                        Time for the first spill: 10 seconds. Further straights:
                        6+ seconds. If you like strong tea, increase the brewing
                        time to 15-20 seconds to taste.

                        The Yixing clay teapot is a reliable pu-erh brewing
                        machine. The clay is called Yixing in the city of Yixing
                        (Kit. 宜兴, "loyalty to duty and prosperity") in the
                        east of China.

                        as well as wine with cheese or tomatoes with cucumbers
                        for a salad. The power of Shu Pu-erh is more often
                        manifested in taste, and the teapot makes the taste of
                        tea more dense and rounded. Thus, if we are guided by
                        the idea of "strengthening the strong and discarding the
                        weak", then the clay teapot is ideal for shu pu-erh

                        The answer to the question "how to brew..." is more
                        difficult than it seems. Those who have been drinking
                        tea for a long time and thoughtfully give
                        recommendations, like experienced housewives in the
                        kitchen. The movements are so honed and familiar that
                        everything turns out delicious even "by eye". To help
                        those who are merely on the verge of higher mastery, we
                        write specific recommendations - how, how much, and in
                        what time frame.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Pu-erh can be different. If Shen's younger brother, Shu
                        (ripe) pu-erh, feels well after 10 seconds in the Yixing
                        kettle, and after an hour in a thermos, then it is
                        imperative to be careful with Shen. He does not tolerate
                        inattention and negligence and becomes bitter. It is
                        worth missing the moment once, and this bitterness will
                        remain with you until the end of the tea party.
                        Therefore, we share the subtleties and tricks for each
                        method of brewing this tea.

                    <p>
                        If you are brewing a particular tea for the first time,
                        then we advise you to show some more care. This is both
                        for the tea itself and for its brewing. Start with 4
                        grams of tea per 100 ml of water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also, when drinking tea with pressed tea, we recommend
                        using a sieve to reduce the likelihood of excessive
                        bitterness.

                    <p>
                        Age matters. Young Sheng (raw) pu-erh differs both in
                        taste and in the subtleties of brewing. Choose a pair of
                        puer of different ages for comparison. The older Sheng
                        (raw) pu-erh is, the higher the boiling water
                        temperature is needed and the more tea leaves can be
                        taken. When brewing aged Sheng (raw) pu-erh, we advise
                        you not to allow the water to cool and to pour boiling
                        water over the kettle more often.

                    <p>
                        We advise you to pour out the first tea leaves. You can
                        do this directly in the kettle as well as warm it up.

                        If you want to brew Sheng (raw) pu-erh in the office, we
                        recommend using the type. It can be safely used in the

                        and the internal sieve will save you from additional

                    <p>
                        Basically, brewing this method does not differ from the
                        method above: we monitor the time and temperature, use
                        boiling water, and do not let the dishes and tea cool
                        down. Take 6-7 grams of tea if you prefer a balanced
                        strength.

                    <p className="font-bold">Thermos</p>
                    <p>
                        Unlike Shu puer or hei cha, sheng should be brewed in a
                        thermos with care. Estimate how much you take in your
                        thermos, and measure 1.5 times less. Usually, for Sheng
                        (raw) pu-erh, it is worth taking 5-6 grams per 500 ml of
                        volume.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Warm up the thermos – rinse it with boiling water so
                        that the cold walls do not sue the tea;{" "}

                    <p>
                        Before it cools down, throw tea into a thermos and pour
                        boiling water: the older the sheng, the hotter the
                        water.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        30 minutes is enough for Shen to infuse in a thermos.
                        Try to choose a whole leaf and do not infuse the tea for
                        more than 3 hours. So you can avoid bitterness!

                    <p>
                        We take a teaspoon of tea for a cup of 200 ml and pour

                    <p>Ready!</p>
                    <p>
                        When the infusion remains in the cup, you can add
                        boiling water again. Thus, the tea can be brewed 2-3
                        times. Or you can immediately make a large mug of
                        fragrant tea without brewing it.

                        How to measure tea without scales? There are about 2
                        grams of tea in a teaspoon without a slide and ~ 3 grams
                        in a teaspoon with a slide.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Tip: Do not use metal sieve balls, because pressed tea
                        will not be able to open and brew properly in them.

                        At the very beginning of the journey, the variety of
                        Chinese tea can be confusing. Do not be afraid ahead of
                        time: there are more than a thousand varieties of
                        Chinese tea, and there are only six types! Let's figure
                        out how this variety fits into a concise classification.

                        Classification of Chinese tea
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, tea is determined by the variety of the
                        tea bush, its geographical location, and its processing.
                        In China, the classification of tea is based on the
                        degree of fermentation of raw materials, i.e. how much
                        tea raw materials undergo enzymatic oxidation after
                        drying. This process in the sheet is artificially
                        interrupted by the following processing process, for
                        example, frying. According to the Chinese
                        classification, all tea is divided into six large
                        groups: white, green, yellow, oolong, red, and black
                        (Pu-erh is included in this category).
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold">White tea</p>
                    <p>
                        The leaf is harvested and dried naturally. Oxidation
                        partially occurs during drying. Fermentation goes on in
                        a special way because the leaf has not crumpled. White
                        tea refers to the color of the most famous variety of
                        Bai Hao Yin Zhen, which is covered with delicate silver
                        fluff. The main volume is produced in Fujian Province.
                        The number of leaves taken together with the kidney will
                        determine the grade and price: tea made entirely from
                        the kidneys is most appreciated. The delicate nature of
                        white tea requires attention, which is a step in the
                        right direction. Its sweetness is similar to birch sap,
                        with a refined bouquet of berries and flowers. Leaf
                        varieties become denser with age, and kidney varieties
                        are better to drink fresh. They open up perfectly during
                        cooking on the fire. Try them!

                        Minimally fermented: the leaf is harvested, dried,
                        twisted, warmed, and dried completely. In it, you will
                        find sweetness, light astringency, and the colors of
                        spring. The feeling of a taut bowstring, a juicy cut of
                        grass will remain on the lips. In green tea, freshness
                        is appreciated, since rare green tea retains its taste
                        for longer than one season. When brewing, it is
                        imperative to monitor the temperature of the water and
                        not overdo it. Gaiwan is ideal for brewing green tea.

                        The degree of fermentation is even higher, but its
                        quality is different — it takes place in a moist, warm
                        environment with limited oxygen access. This process is
                        called "languor". The taste of yellow is closer to
                        green, but the emphasis shifts to depth, softness, and
                        mystery. Notes of bitter almonds and smoky caramel
                        appear. Tea of this quality is impressive and elite.
                        Yellow tea is a rarity in the market. Buy this tea only
                        from trusted sellers, because there are many fakes on

                        Oolong begins with a special kind of shrub with fleshy
                        leaves for making. Oolongs are divided into two large
                        groups: light and dark. The light ones come into contact
                        with the green and yellow ones according to their taste
                        profile, but they are often more fragrant and denser.
                        Dark teas are closer to red teas. Between these poles,
                        there is a gamut of flavors with countless nuances.
                        Cooking technology involves fermentation from partial to
                        almost complete, with or without baking in the end. The
                        most diverse group of teas. The aromatics of oolongs are
                        complex and bright, the taste is multilevel, unfolding
                        over time, and can resemble perfume and essential oils.
                        Oolongs are the heart and crown of the art of drinking
                        tea.

                        Sheng (raw) pu-erh is similar in manufacturing
                        technology to green teas, but they are not thermally
                        fixed in the final product, so they develop and change
                        over time. Shen teas are similar to green teas in that
                        they are bright, springy, and herbaceous. As they age,
                        they lose their audacity, and bitterness, and sink into
                        the nectar depth, like dried fruits. It is noteworthy
                        that old trees over 300 years old can be used for sheng
                        (raw) pu-erh.

                        Shu (ripe) pu-erh passes through the process of wet

                        tea leaf enzymes and the symbiosis of fungal microflora.
                        In the case of shu, the shutter speed of pancakes does
                        not matter. Raw materials, maturation processes, and the
                        technical level will have the biggest influence on
                        taste. Shu is appreciated for its nuts, chocolate, dried
                        fruits profile, and smooth, powerful body. He is
                        easy-going in brewing even for a beginner and loves

                        Gaiwan is a traditional dish for brewing Chinese tea. It
                        consists of a bowl, a lid, and sometimes a saucer. In
                        addition to being able to make extremely fast brewing,
                        the gaiwan allows you to control the temperature of the
                        water and effectively convey the aroma of the tea leaf.

                    <p>
                        The volume of the gaiwan varies from 80 to 300 ml.

                    <p className="font-bold">History</p>
                    <p>
                        Gaiwan came into mass use in the XIV–XV centuries.
                        Initially, it consisted only of a cup without a handle
                        and lid. Over time, gaiwan began to be made with a
                        stand-saucer. Thus, I was able to drink tea directly
                        from the cup while keeping it on weight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason for the mass use of gaywani was the spread of
                        leaf tea. Before that, the Chinese mostly drank either
                        pressed tea, which had to be brewed, or powdered tea,
                        which was dissolved. With the evolving form of tea,
                        there was also a need for an additional convenient
                        object for brewing.
                    </p>

                        will not stain the table, it is more convenient to drink
                        directly from the gaiwan, and you can also brew tea
                        without using a Chaban (Tea Tray).

                            There is a difference in size, material, and design
                            between gaiwan.
                        </p>
                    <p>
                        According to the material, gaywani are made of
                        porcelain, glass, and clay. The fragrance remains on the
                        lid wall of porcelain gaiwans for a longer period of
                        time. Glass gaiwans keep the heat for less time and the
                        tea cools faster, but it allows you to admire the color
                        of the infusion. In gaiwan made of clay, tea cools down
                        more slowly, and the gaiwan itself eventually develops,
                        like the Yixing teapot.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold">
                        Which is better: a gaiwan or a teapot?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For Chinese tea brewing, a gaiwan and a teapot are the
                        two main tools. Which one should I choose?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We chose both. For some teas, a gaiwan is better suited,
                        while for others, a teapot is better suited.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With a gaiwan, you can feel the aroma of tea more
                        vividly, and with a teapot, you can see a richer taste.
                        Therefore, super-fresh teas or teas with a powerful
                        aroma are traditionally brewed in a gaiwan, and teas
                        with a less pronounced aroma are brewed in a teapot.
                        However, it all depends on what you want to get from a
                        particular tea party.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, the harbor is considered a more
                        versatile item. This is because most of them are made of
                        porcelain or glass, which do not absorb the aroma of tea
                        when brewed. Therefore, if you choose the first item for
                        brewing, we advise you to start with it.

                        There are 2 ways to use a gaiwan for tea drinking. You

                        teapot and the cup: Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei). This is a
                        small vessel that resembles a milkman to many. It is
                        believed that it is absolutely necessary at tea parties
                        where more than one person is present.

                        ‍Why is Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) needed?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After brewing in a teapot or gaiwan, the drink is filled
                        into Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) and then poured into cups
                        from it. If you drink tea alone, then it is not
                        necessary to use it.
                    </p>
                    <p className="font-bold">
                        Why is Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) convenient?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Allows you to control the fortress. If you pour tea from
                        a teapot / gaiwan immediately into cups, each subsequent
                        cup will get stronger. If you pour the whole infusion
                        into Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) at once, then you get the
                        same strength for all participants of the tea party.
                        That is why it is called the cup of justice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is convenient to divide tea equally among all
                        participants. For example, it is much more difficult to
                        pour evenly straight from the gaiwan (this requires a
                        certain gunfu). That's because the gaiwan is covered
                        with a lid, and you don't see how much infusion is left
                        inside. Therefore, use Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) so as not
                        to offend anyone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Makes it possible to freeze the infusion. In Cha Hai
                        (Gong Dao Bei), you can hold tea that is too hot for a
                        while so that it cools down to a comfortable
                        temperature. At the same time, it will not be over
                        brewed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's easier to give up the sieve. During a tea party
                        without a tea sieve, you can wait for a while until the
                        small tea leaves settle to the bottom. So they won't get
                        into the cups.

                        Aesthetics. Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) made of glass or
                        white porcelain will allow you to admire the color of
                        the infusion, while Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei) with complex
                        designs will decorate any tea scene.

                    <p>
                        It's easy to buy a Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei). You should
                        only consider three factors when choosing: its volume,
                        its design, and its appearance.

                            Universal option: a glass Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei)

                    <p>
                        The volume is selected for the volume of the kettle /
                        gaiwan. Usually, the nominal volume of utensils is
                        indicated in stores, so the volume of Cha Hai (Gong Dao
                        Bei) should be slightly larger. When tea is not filled
                        to the brim, it is more convenient to use it. For
                        example, for a 200 ml gaiwan, you need at least 250 ml
                        of Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei).

                        It is best to take a model with a handle if this is your
                        first Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei): it will prevent you from
                        getting burned. If you are already an experienced tea
                        enthusiast, then pay attention to the Cha Hai (Gong Dao
                        Bei), similar to a bowl with a spout. For example, such
