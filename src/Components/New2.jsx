                        Matcha tea has gained immense popularity in World
                        recently. The name "抹茶" (mattya or matcha) translates
                        from Japanese as "ground tea." Contrary to common myth,
                        this tea was invented in China, not in Japan as commonly
                        believed. During the Tang Dynasty in China (618-907 AD),
                        tea leaves were roasted and ground into a powder, which
                        was then brewed with salt and mint. During the Song
                        Dynasty (960-1279 AD), powdered tea became more popular:
                        it was brewed by pouring hot water over the tea powder
                        in a cup and whisking it with a bamboo whisk until a
                        frothy layer formed. The preparation of powdered tea
                        became a ritual among the Chan Buddhists. They brought
                        tea to Japan along with Buddhism. This led to the
                        formation of the Zen school and the transformation of
                        the tea-drinking process into a complex ceremony with
                        many rules and conventions.

                        type of tea requires its own approach. Red and green

                        relevant for loose tea, which is difficult to transfer
                        to boiling water until you give the mass a round
                        contour.

                        Dense teas in tea heads can be boiled a little to fully
                        reveal the aroma. It is permissible to turn off such tea

                        It is worth noting that this brewing method can help to
                        reveal the taste of teas that were exclusively used in
                        tea bags. Traditional Shu Pu-erh tea becomes a light

                        voluminous, oily, velvety, and wonderfully drinkable.
                        Conversely, the tea that you enjoy in a tea bag may not
                        reveal its full charm when brewed. However, it is still
                        worth trying and conducting experiments.

                        classic of Lu Yu and delve into the philosophical
                        teachings. It states:
                    </h4>
                    <h4 className="mb-5 sm:mb-[1vw]">
                        "Tea, by its nature, is modest, and it should not be
                        brewed in large quantities. If tea is brewed in large
                        quantities, its taste becomes weak and bland. Sometimes,
                        after filling a cup and drinking half of it, one feels
                        the poor taste. What can be said about a large quantity?
                        The tea color is pale yellow, and its aroma is stunning.
                        If the taste of the drink is sweet, then it is Jia. If
                        it is not sweet, but bitter - it is Chuan. If it is
                        bitter when swallowed, but sweet in the throat, then it
                        is true tea."

                        a special tube for draining water. So spilled liquid

                        with frequent use, the glue can leak, especially if the
                        pallet also consists of bamboo. When buying bamboo
                        Chabans (Tea Trays), be sure to check the evenness of
                        the joints and the quality of the assembly.

                        Chabans (Tea Trays) should drain well and completely,

                        crack and will not chip. A Chaban (Tea tray) can be used
                        for decades, but its disadvantages include rarity,
                        weight, and price. If the stone Chaban (Tea tray) has
                        wooden / metal inserts, make sure they dry after tea.
                        Use soda if you can't wipe off the tea stain with a wet
                        cloth. Besides effectively removing the stain, it leaves
                        no foreign odor on the Chaban (tea tray).

                        and reliable, but they have one significant
                        disadvantage: noise. Remember the sound of rain drumming
                        on the metallic tint of the window? If such a roar can

                        Sometimes it is a pull-out, most often a plastic pallet.
                        In some Chabans (Tea Trays), the base itself serves as a
                        pallet. The first option is easier to care for, since
                        the base made of wood/bamboo may crack if used
                        incorrectly.

                        brewing. It combines a teapot (a flask with a button), a

                        there). Three in one! Brew tea by spilling or infusing —

                        In most models of these types, the spout bends slightly

                        So you will get three, five, or more flavors from one
                        brew. Use boiling water.

                        Take 8 grams of tea if you like a balanced strength.
                        Time of the first welding: 10 seconds. Further straits:
                        6+ seconds. Do you like strong shu pu-erh? Increase the
                        brewing time to 15-20 seconds, and use 10-15 grams
                        instead of 8.

                        Gaiwan (more often porcelain or glass) is a special cup
                        with a lid for brewing tea. The walls of the gaiwan do
                        not absorb the aroma or taste of tea (unlike a clay
                        teapot). With a gaiwan, it is easy to control the drain
                        speed. This is critical because controlled draining plus
                        ease of use allows you to cope with even the most
                        "capricious" tea. When you brew tea in a gaiwan, the
                        reverse side of the lid collects a bright and clean
                        aroma. Pay attention to him. Gaiwan is suitable for
                        those who want to control the brewing process and
                        appreciate the aroma more than the taste.

                        If you use a gaiwan, it is better to brew tea in spills.
                        Spillage brewing is when you make fast (up to 1 second)
                        brews. Each individual brew is called a spill, because
                        the water does not linger in the dishes, but "spills"
                        through them into a bowl, turning into tea. The first
                        spill is soft and delicate. The second one is visible
                        and bright. There is a mature taste peak in the third
                        spill. The fourth is the beginning of a gradual fading.
                        Together, all brewing is called the "melody of taste".
                        Each tea has its own melody.

                        Chinese tea can be confusing. Do not be afraid ahead of
                        time: there are more than a thousand varieties of
                        Chinese tea, and there are only six types! Let's figure
                        out how this variety fits into a concise classification.

                        Classification of Chinese tea
                    </h4>
                    <h4 className="mb-5 sm:mb-[1vw]">
                        First of all, tea is determined by the variety of the
                        tea bush, its geographical location, and its processing.
                        In China, the classification of tea is based on the
                        degree of fermentation of raw materials, i.e. how much
                        tea raw materials undergo enzymatic oxidation after
                        drying. This process in the sheet is artificially
                        interrupted by the following processing process, for
                        example, frying. According to the Chinese
                        classification, all tea is divided into six large
                        groups: white, green, yellow, oolong, red, and black
                        (Pu-erh is included in this category).

                    <h4>
                        The leaf is harvested and dried naturally. Oxidation
                        partially occurs during drying. Fermentation goes on in
                        a special way because the leaf has not crumpled. White
                        tea refers to the color of the most famous variety of
                        Bai Hao Yin Zhen, which is covered with delicate silver
                        fluff. The main volume is produced in Fujian Province.
                        The number of leaves taken together with the kidney will
                        determine the grade and price: tea made entirely from
                        the kidneys is most appreciated. The delicate nature of
                        white tea requires attention, which is a step in the
                        right direction. Its sweetness is similar to birch sap,
                        with a refined bouquet of berries and flowers. Leaf
                        varieties become denser with age, and kidney varieties
                        are better to drink fresh. They open up perfectly during
                        cooking on the fire. Try them!

                        leaves for making. Oolongs are divided into two large
                        groups: light and dark. The light ones come into contact
                        with the green and yellow ones according to their taste
                        profile, but they are often more fragrant and denser.
                        Dark teas are closer to red teas. Between these poles,
                        there is a gamut of flavors with countless nuances.
                        Cooking technology involves fermentation from partial to
                        almost complete, with or without baking in the end. The
                        most diverse group of teas. The aromatics of oolongs are
                        complex and bright, the taste is multilevel, unfolding
                        over time, and can resemble perfume and essential oils.
                        Oolongs are the heart and crown of the art of drinking
                        tea.

                        Gaiwan came into mass use in the XIV–XV centuries.
                        Initially, it consisted only of a cup without a handle
                        and lid. Over time, gaiwan began to be made with a
                        stand-saucer. Thus, I was able to drink tea directly
                        from the cup while keeping it on weight.

                        The reason for the mass use of gaywani was the spread of

                        pressed tea, which had to be brewed, or powdered tea,
                        which was dissolved. With the evolving form of tea,
                        there was also a need for an additional convenient
                        object for brewing.

                        like the Yixing teapot.

                        For Chinese tea brewing, a gaiwan and a teapot are the

                    <h4 className="mb-5 sm:mb-[1vw]">
                        We chose both. For some teas, a gaiwan is better suited,
                        while for others, a teapot is better suited.

                    <h4 className="mb-5 sm:mb-[1vw]">
                        With a gaiwan, you can feel the aroma of tea more
                        vividly, and with a teapot, you can see a richer taste.
                        Therefore, super-fresh teas or teas with a powerful
                        aroma are traditionally brewed in a gaiwan, and teas
                        with a less pronounced aroma are brewed in a teapot.
                        However, it all depends on what you want to get from a
                        particular tea party.

                        At the same time, the harbor is considered a more
                        versatile item. This is because most of them are made of
                        porcelain or glass, which do not absorb the aroma of tea
                        when brewed. Therefore, if you choose the first item for
                        brewing, we advise you to start with it.

                        only consider three factors when choosing: its volume,
                        its design, and its appearance.

                        The volume is selected for the volume of the kettle /
                        gaiwan. Usually, the nominal volume of utensils is
                        indicated in stores, so the volume of Cha Hai (Gong Dao
                        Bei) should be slightly larger. When tea is not filled
                        to the brim, it is more convenient to use it. For
                        example, for a 200 ml gaiwan, you need at least 250 ml
                        of Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei).

                        It is best to take a model with a handle if this is your
                        first Cha Hai (Gong Dao Bei): it will prevent you from
                        getting burned. If you are already an experienced tea
                        enthusiast, then pay attention to the Cha Hai (Gong Dao
                        Bei), similar to a bowl with a spout. For example, such
                        as:
