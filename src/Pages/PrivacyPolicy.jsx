                                Google Analytics is a web analytics service
                                offered by Google that tracks and reports
                                website traffic. Google uses the data collected
                                to track and monitor the use of our Service.
                                This data is shared with other Google services.
                                Google may use the collected data to
                                contextualize and personalize the ads of its own
                                advertising network. <br />
                                You can opt-out of having made your activity on
                                the Service available to Google Analytics by
                                installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser
                                add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics
                                JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from
                                sharing information with Google Analytics about
                                visits activity. <br />
